README for Copy Transforms Helper add-on in Blender

Full transparency. This took about a weeks worth of generating in ChatGPT for a parenting problem I had with a rig. that has been fixed, and now I have a code that I don't need.
Life can be funny at times.

Introduction:
Copy Transforms Helper is an add-on for Blender that provides a set of tools to assist with copying transforms between bones. It allows you to align bone handles, enable/disable links between bones, and set keyframes for rotation.

Installation:

Download the Copy Transforms Helper add-on.

In Blender, go to Edit -> Preferences.

In the Add-ons tab, click on "Install".

Navigate to the downloaded add-on file and select it.

Enable the add-on by checking the checkbox next to "Copy Transforms Helper" in the Add-ons tab.
Usage:

Align Handles - This tool aligns the bone handles of selected bones to the active bone's handle. To use it, select the active bone and at least one other bone, then click the "Align Bones" button in the "Copy Transform Helper" panel located in the N-panel.

Enable Link - This tool enables a copy transforms constraint between two selected bones. To use it, select two bones, with one of them being the active bone, then click the "Enable" button in the "Copy Transform Helper" panel. A copy transforms constraint will be created on the non-active bone with the active bone as the target.

Disable Link - This tool disables a copy transforms constraint on the selected bone. To use it, select a bone that has a copy transforms constraint with an influence of 1, then click the "Disable" button in the "Copy Transform Helper" panel.

Set Rotation Keyframes - This tool sets keyframes for rotation. To use it, enable the checkbox in the "Copy Transform Helper" panel.
Location:
The Copy Transforms Helper panel can be found in the N-panel in the 3D Viewport. It is located in the "Transform Helper" category when in Pose Mode.

Compatibility:
This add-on is compatible with Blender version 2.90.0 and newer.

Can reuse the same constraint: I dont know how it works on the coding side, but you are more than free to look at it. but as long as you have
only once constaint that has an influence of 1, it should work seamlessly.
